# Implementation Changes for vit_mae_large Model Evaluation

## Problem Fixed

The implementation fixes an error that occurs during model evaluation with the `vit_mae_large` model:

```
Error during model forward pass: index 1 is out of bounds for dimension 1 with size 1. Skipping batch.
```

This error was causing all batches to be skipped during evaluation, resulting in empty arrays being passed to the metrics calculation functions, which then led to the final error:

```
ValueError: Found array with 0 sample(s) (shape=(0,)) while a minimum of 1 is required.
```

## Changes Made

The fix modifies the forward pass code in `evaluation_2.py` to handle the different output format of the `vit_mae_large` model:

### Before:

```python
# Forward pass
try:
    with torch.no_grad():
        output = model(img).softmax(1)[:, 1].cpu().data.numpy()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during model forward pass: {str(e)}. Skipping batch.")
    continue
```

### After:

```python
# Forward pass
try:
    with torch.no_grad():
        raw_output = model(img)

        # Process output based on model type
        if model_type == "vit_mae_large":
            # For ViT-MAE with sigmoid activation (already applied in model's forward method)
            # The output should have shape [batch_size, 1]
            output = raw_output.squeeze(1).detach().cpu().numpy()
        else:
            # For other models using softmax
            # The output should have shape [batch_size, num_classes]
            output = raw_output.softmax(dim=1)[:, 1].detach().cpu().numpy()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during model forward pass: {str(e)}. Skipping batch.")
    continue
```

## Explanation

The `vit_mae_large` model outputs a tensor with shape `[batch_size, 1]` containing sigmoid-activated probabilities, while other models output tensors with shape `[batch_size, num_classes]` that need softmax activation.

The original code was trying to apply softmax and access index 1 of dimension 1 for all model types, but for the `vit_mae_large` model, dimension 1 only has size 1 (only index 0 exists), causing the "index out of bounds" error.

The fix adds a conditional check for the `vit_mae_large` model type and processes the output differently:
- For `vit_mae_large`, it uses `squeeze(1)` to remove the extra dimension and get a flat array
- For other models, it continues to use `softmax(dim=1)[:, 1]` to get the probability of class 1

Additionally, the fix replaces `.cpu().data.numpy()` with `.detach().cpu().numpy()`, which is the recommended approach in PyTorch:
- `detach()` explicitly creates a new tensor that doesn't require gradients
- This is clearer in intent than using `.data`, which is considered somewhat deprecated

This change makes the evaluation code consistent with how model outputs are handled in the training code (`train__.py`), which already had this model-specific handling.

## Expected Outcome

With this change, the evaluation code should correctly handle the output format of the `vit_mae_large` model, preventing the "index out of bounds" error and allowing the evaluation to proceed normally.

The solution is robust because:
- It handles the specific issue with the `vit_mae_large` model
- It's consistent with how the model output is handled in other parts of the codebase
- It leverages the existing `model_type` parameter that's already being passed to the function
