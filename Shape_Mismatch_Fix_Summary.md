# Shape Mismatch Fix Summary

## Issue

The code was encountering a shape mismatch error when using BCE loss:

```
ValueError: Using a target size (torch.Size([64])) that is different to the input size (torch.Size([64, 2])) is deprecated. Please ensure they have the same size.
```

This error occurred because:
1. The model was outputting a tensor of shape `[batch_size, 2]` (two values per sample)
2. The target tensor had shape `[batch_size]` (one value per sample)
3. BCE loss requires the input and target to have the same shape

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified Model Output in model.py

```python
# Before:
logits = self.classifier(cls_token)
x = torch.sigmoid(logits)  # Convert logits to probabilities

# After:
logits = self.classifier(cls_token)
# For binary classification, we need to return a single value per sample
# Take the second column (index 1) which represents the probability of class 1
# and apply sigmoid to get a probability
x = torch.sigmoid(logits[:, 1]).unsqueeze(1)  # Shape: [batch_size, 1]
```

This change ensures the model outputs a tensor of shape `[batch_size, 1]` instead of `[batch_size, 2]`.

### 2. Modified Target Reshaping in train__.py (Training Loop)

```python
# Before:
target_float = target.float()

# After:
target_float = target.float().unsqueeze(1)  # Shape: [batch_size, 1]
```

This change reshapes the target tensor to match the model output shape.

### 3. Modified Target Reshaping in train__.py (Validation Loop)

```python
# Before:
target_float = target.float()

# After:
target_float = target.float().unsqueeze(1)  # Shape: [batch_size, 1]
```

Same change for the validation loop.

### 4. Updated Output Processing for Metrics Calculation (Training)

```python
# Before:
train_outputs.extend(output.detach().cpu().numpy().tolist())

# After:
train_outputs.extend(output.squeeze(1).detach().cpu().numpy().tolist())
```

This change squeezes the output tensor to remove the extra dimension before converting to a list.

### 5. Updated Output Processing for Metrics Calculation (Validation)

```python
# Before:
val_outputs.extend(output.cpu().data.numpy().tolist())

# After:
val_outputs.extend(output.squeeze(1).cpu().data.numpy().tolist())
```

Same change for the validation outputs.

## Explanation

### Binary Classification with BCE Loss

For binary classification with BCE loss, there are two common approaches:

1. **Single Output Value**: The model outputs a single value per sample (shape `[batch_size, 1]`), which represents the probability of the positive class. The target is also a single value per sample (0 or 1).

2. **Two Output Values**: The model outputs two values per sample (shape `[batch_size, 2]`), which represent the logits for each class. This is typically used with CrossEntropyLoss, not BCE loss.

Our implementation now follows the first approach, which is more appropriate for BCE loss.

### Why This Works

1. **Consistent Shapes**: Both the model output and target now have the same shape `[batch_size, 1]`, which is required by BCE loss.

2. **Proper Probability Interpretation**: We're taking the logit for class 1 (positive class) and applying sigmoid to get a probability between 0 and 1.

3. **Metrics Calculation**: When calculating metrics like AUC and EER, we squeeze the output to get a flat list of probabilities, which is what these metrics expect.

## Expected Impact

These changes should resolve the shape mismatch error and allow the model to train properly. The model will now:

1. Output a single probability value per sample
2. Compare this probability to the target label (0 or 1)
3. Calculate the BCE loss correctly
4. Update the weights based on the gradients

The training process should now proceed without errors, and the model should be able to learn to distinguish between real and morphed images.
